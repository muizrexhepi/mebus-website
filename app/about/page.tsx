                  The HakBus Beginning
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Our story began with HakBus, the Balkans' most renowned bus
                  operator. We developed a cutting-edge online ticketing system
                  that revolutionized their operations, making it easier for
                  passengers to book and manage their travel.

                  Birth of GoBusly
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Inspired by our success with HakBus, we identified a gap in
                  the market. Many bus operators in the Balkans lacked online
                  sales capabilities, limiting their reach and inconveniencing
                  passengers. This realization led to the creation of GoBusly, a
                  platform designed to serve the entire region.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Today, GoBusly is more than just a ticketing system; it's a
                  platform that connects bus operators across the Balkans with
                  their passengers. We're bridging the digital divide, bringing
                  the convenience of online booking to a region where it was
                  once a rarity.
